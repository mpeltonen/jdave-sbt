Simple support for executing JDave (http://www.jdave.org/) specs written in Scala
with xsbt (https://github.com/harrah/xsbt). 

1) ./sbt clean package
2) Add jdave-sbt to testFramework in your project definition to include jdave support:

   testFrameworks += new TestFramework("org.jdave.sbt.JDaveFramework")
